# Crypto Clustering

This was an exercise on unsupervised machine learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
First, the market data is loaded into a DataFrame. Then, the summary statistics is obtained and the data is plotted to visualize it.


NOTE: I worked on this assignment alone. However, I followed the code examples in the class activities to do the work.
